# the database:

use sql.script file in the project

**Prerequisites:**

1. Make sure you have SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) installed on your computer.

2. Ensure you have the SQL script file that you want to import. This file should contain the SQL commands to create the database and its objects.

**Importing the Database Script:**

1. Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) on your computer.

2. Connect to your SQL Server instance if you haven't already. You can do this by entering the server name, authentication method, and credentials in the "Connect to Server" dialog.

3. Once connected, open a new query window by clicking "New Query" in the toolbar or pressing `Ctrl+N`.

4. In the query window, open the SQL script file you want to import. You can do this by either:

   - Clicking "File" in the menu, selecting "Open," and choosing the SQL script file.
   - Copying and pasting the contents of the SQL script file into the query window.

5. Review the SQL script to ensure it contains the necessary commands to create the database and its objects (tables, views, procedures, etc.).

6. Execute the script by clicking the "Execute" button in the toolbar (or pressing `F5`). This will run the SQL commands in the script and create the database and objects specified in the script.

7. After the script has been executed successfully, you should see a message indicating that the commands completed successfully.

**Verifying the Imported Database:**

1. In the Object Explorer on the left side of SSMS, expand the "Databases" node to see a list of available databases.

2. Look for the database you just imported. It should be listed among the databases.

3. You can now work with the imported database by expanding its nodes in the Object Explorer to access tables, views, and other objects.

That's it! You've successfully imported a database script into SQL Server Management Studio. The imported database and its objects should now be available for use in your SQL Server instance.

# Running the program/opening the project


**Downloading Files from GitHub:**

1. Visit the GitHub repository that contains the project 

2. On the GitHub repository page, look for a "Code" button. It's usually located near the top-right corner of the page.

3. Click the "Code" button to open a dropdown menu. You'll have two options: "Download ZIP" or "Copy the URL." Choose "Download ZIP" to download the entire repository as a compressed ZIP file.

4. Save the ZIP file to a location on your computer where you want to work on the project.

5. Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the ZIP file. This will create a folder containing the project files.

**Opening the Project in Visual Studio:**

1. Open Visual Studio on your computer. If you don't have Visual Studio installed, you can download and install it from the official website.

2. In Visual Studio, go to "File" > "Open" > "Project/Solution."

3. Browse to the location where you extracted the project files from the ZIP archive.

4. In the file dialog, locate the project's .sln file. It usually has the same name as the project and has a .sln extension (e.g., MyProject.sln).

5. Select the .sln file and click the "Open" button.

6. Visual Studio will load the solution along with all its associated projects.

7. In the Solution Explorer panel (usually located on the right-hand side), you'll see the projects and files that are part of the solution.

8. Double-click on the specific project you want to work on to open it. This will display the project's files and allow you to start editing and working on the project.

9. You can now use Visual Studio to edit, build, debug, and run the project.

Now you have successfully downloaded project files from GitHub and opened them in Visual Studio, allowing you to work on your project within the Visual Studio development environment.
